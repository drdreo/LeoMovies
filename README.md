# LeoMovies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The purpose of this project is to showcase my style of working with React for a recruitment assessment.  

It uses data of [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and is hosted at [Heroku](https://leomovies.herokuapp.com/).


### Used libs

- Integrated [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) as a style library. 
- For fetching data, the native "fetch" API was used. 
- I haven't used [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with React yet, so i tried that for E2E testing. Cypress is great ‚ù§Ô∏è.
- [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/github/drdreo/LeoMovies) is used for CI
